[project]
# This is the name of your project. The first time you publish this
# package, this name will be registered for you. It will determine how
# users can install this project, e.g.:
#
# $ pip install sampleproject
#
# And where it will live on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/sampleproject/
#
# There are some restrictions on what makes a valid project name
# specification here:
# https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#name
name = "palette"  # Required

# Versions should comply with PEP 440:
# https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/
#
# For a discussion on single-sourcing the version, see
# https://packaging.python.org/guides/single-sourcing-package-version/
version = "0.0.1"  # Required

# This is a one-line description or tagline of what your project does. This
# corresponds to the "Summary" metadata field:
# https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#summary
description = "A Python package implementation of the Palette diffusion model"  # Optional

# This is an optional longer description of your project that represents
# the body of text which users will see when they visit PyPI.
#
# Often, this is the same as your README, so you can just read it in from
# that file directly (as we have already done above)
#
# This field corresponds to the "Description" metadata field:
# https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#description-optional
readme = "README.md" # Optional

# Specify which Python versions you support. In contrast to the
# 'Programming Language' classifiers above, 'pip install' will check this
# and refuse to install the project if the version does not match. See
# https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#python-requires

# This field adds keywords for your project which will appear on the

  # Pick your license as you wish
  "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",

  # Specify the Python versions you support here. In particular, ensure
  # that you indicate you support Python 3. These classifiers are *not*
